# Integer-Partitions
An algorithm which returns all the possible ways to get the sum of a number.

-------------------

To elaborate on the above description, here is all of the integer partitions of 4:

- 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
- 1 + 1 + 2
- 1 + 3
- 2 + 2

All of the above sums add up to 4, and as you increase the number inputted, the ways to get a sum for them increase exponentially. This program will display ALL of these sums for the number provided.
